How to Permanently Disable the Startup Sound
To permanently disable the startup sound so it isn’t played at startup, even if you have your volume level set to maximum volume when you shut down, you need to use a terminal command.

To do this, open a Terminal window

Run the following command in the terminal window:

	sudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%80


Enter your password when prompted and press Enter. Restart your Mac and you won’t hear the sound.
